## 1. Business Problem

Retail businesses often struggle to understand which products, customers, and regions truly drive profitability. Disconnected analysis across tools can limit visibility into customer behavior, discount impact, and long-term customer value.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **sales analytics and business intelligence** solution to support data-driven commercial decision-making.

## 2. Objective

Build a complete analytics pipeline to:

- Track sales, profit, orders, and customer trends  
- Identify high- and low-performing products and categories  
- Assess the impact of discounting on profitability  
- Segment customers using **RFM analysis** to identify high-value and at-risk segments  
- Deliver insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard  

---

## 3. Dataset Overview

- Public Superstore sales dataset  
- Includes orders, products, customers, regions, discounts, sales, and profit  
- Cleaned and prepared using Python before downstream analysis

## 5. Approach & Tools
